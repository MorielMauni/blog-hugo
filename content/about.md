## About Me:

Hello, My name is Moriel Mauni, I'm  a DevOps engineer / System Administrator based in TLV/IL.
I'm a **fast learner** **quick to adapt**, used to **work under pressure** (FKA EMT)

### Personal life:
As for now, I'm 29 y/o, married with 1 boy.
Until age of 27 (around the start of 2023) my focus was on my carrier as an EMT. After this I was all in about tech.

#### I like PC gaming, mostly play:
1. Call of Duty: really love MW.
2. Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links and Master Duel.
  - Fun Fact, I went to Worlds at 2019 as a gust.
4. Maplestory: sometimes it's fun and brainless.


### My tech slack:
1. Linux
  - Server
  - Different distributions
  - dotfiles management with chezmoi and mise.
2. AWS 
3. Azure
4. Terraform
5. Docker
6. Kubernetes
7. Jenkins
8. Python
9. Bash 
10. GO
