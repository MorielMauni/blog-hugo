### Hi friends!

It's been sometime.

After a weel and a half of searching for a new home, We are packaging out self in boxes for the move.
I played little bit with talescale and then when I did --node-exit some apps died on me - like my dear Nextcloud that's hold everything for us for the past 3 years.
Today, I couldn't ssh into the machine and I saw it's froze. After a reboot it's only rebooted to bios.
So have app I host on my Home-lab is gone. BUT! I have all the manifets and I can re-host it with no problem.

Also, thanks to the why I worked (all credit goes to KubeCraft), I have all my files on my Arch laptop and can work on GitHub worksapces because everything is a DevPod. So I can edit "online" everything I need.

I bought a mini pc only for Nextcloud- my wife use it for work so I won't touch it, only updates.

I want to try to use Proxmox with the broken server, I want to try more things in new ways.

### I'm still off, can say I'm off everything, I will come back slowly.

Thank you all,

Moriel
