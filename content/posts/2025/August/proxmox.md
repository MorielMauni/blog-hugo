### Proxmox

After my Ubuntu server died on my I was thinking what am I going to do now. I could re-making the Kubernetes home-lab again with a snap, I got everything in YAML format and it won't take long.

But I wanted to try more things, to get more hands-on on different stuff.

I recovered what I could from the Nextcloud server that was on this laptop and bought a mini PC (Lenovo ThinkCenter M93P) gave him 1T of SATA III and booted Nextcloud on it.
I took the laptop that was used for almost 4 years as a home-lab and installed Proxmox v9.0.3 on it.

#### Setup

To be honest, the setup is really up front, no weird things I needed to do, no tweaks, just plain on "next" and "confirm"
