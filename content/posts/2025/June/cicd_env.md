My GitHub repository for the project: https://github.com/MorielMauni/devops-study-app 

## Setting up the DevPod

### Make a GitHub repository

I will name main as **devops-study-app** and this will be the root directory as well. 
### .devcontainer/devcontainer.json

- Building a Dockerfile and after the creation going to run "scripts/setup". 
- We install the "Docker in Docker" feature.
- Open ports 22111, 22112

```
{
  "build": {
    "context": "..",
    "dockerfile": "Dockerfile"
  },
  "postCreateCommand": "scripts/setup",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2": {}
  },
  "forwardPorts": [
    "22111",
    "22112"
  ]
}
```

### .devcontainer/Dockerfile

- Base image of Ubuntu
- installing mise
```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu-24.04

COPY --from=jdxcode/mise /usr/local/bin/mise /usr/local/bin/

RUN echo 'eval "$(mise activate bash)"' >> /home/vscode/.bashrc && \
  echo 'eval "$(mise activate zsh)"' >> /home/vscode/.zshrc
```

### scripts/setup
```
mkdir scripts
nvim scripts/setup
```

```
echo "This is a placeholder for the script to run"
```

```
chmod +x setup
```

Run in the root directory : 
```
devpod up . 
```

### Installing with mise
```
mise use python@3.13
```

We now have a mise.toml file and we can add it this:
```
[tools]
python = "3.13"
uv = "latest"

[settings]
python.uv_venv_auto = true
idiomatic_version_file_enable_tools = ["python"]
experimental = true

[env]
APP_REPO = '<GitHub-repository-name>'
GITOPS_REPO = '<GitOps-repository-name>'
```

In this we:
mise settings:
- Adding uv (Python package) to the container.
- python.uv_venv_auto = true : when running uv inside the project it detect the virtual environment and activate it.
-  Work with:
	- idiomatic_version_file_enable_tools = ["python"]
	- experimental = true


#### Trust mise & install using the setup script

In scripts/setup, edit the file to contain this: 
```
#!/bin/bash

/usr/local/bin/mise trust /workspaces/"$DEVPOD_WORKSPACE_ID"/mise.toml && /usr/local/bin/mise install
```

now run:
```
./scripts/setup
```

Now all the apps, settings and environments are up with the changes we made.

### Install Commitizan and pre-commit

**Commitizan**: A tool that's help to create commit messages. [Commitizan](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/)  helps to write good commits. 
**pre-commit**: A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) .

Add this to mise.toml
```
[hooks]
enter = "bash ./scripts/setup_project"
```

- triggered when entering to the project

scripts/setup_project
```
#!/bin/bash

if ! command -v cz >/dev/null && [ "$DEVPOD" = "true" ]; then
  git config --global push.autoSetupRemote true
  git config --global --add safe.directory /workspaces/$DEVPOD_WORKSPACE_ID
  pip install --user pipx
  pipx install commitizen
  pre-commit install
  pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
fi
```

-  Checks if Commitizan is  not installed and we inside a DevPod, it runs:
	-  Setup git configs 
	- Install pipx
	- Install Commitizan
	- Install pre-commit hooks

#### Insallation

```
mise use pre-commit
```

settings up the pre-commit hook:

.pre-commit-config.yaml
```
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen
    rev: v1.17.0
    hooks:
      - id: commitizen
        stages: [commit-msg]
```

Now if we exit the DevPod and ssh back in, it going to install all the configuration we did:
```bash 
$ devpod ssh

### First commit

now when we 
```
git commit -m "first commit"
```

Commitizen will activate and check the commit if it's valid:
```bash 
git commit -m "first commit"

```

So, we can use cz to commit a message:
```
cz commit
```

Follow the QA and then it will commit it.

``` bash
cz commit
