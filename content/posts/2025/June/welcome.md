## About the blog:
I'm going to share my work here, new and old stuff that I made, way I picked something above something else.
Even will show my notes sometimes.

## Introduction:

## Hi, name is Moriel Mauni.
#### Back in 2022 I made a choice to leave EMT behind and trying to get myself a job that will give me more.
I like to study, for real. It's the one of the greatest way to be odd but in a good way. Before the Corona virus, I was in university studying in nursing school. Man, I was learning 16 hours a day and having fun with it, also keeping a full time day job because someone needs to pay the bill.

### So what happened?
I felt I was wasn't appreciated by my manages. They always were saying "You will get the Advance EMT course next" and then, nothing.
So, I met my wife in a weird way at work. She showed me that I'm worthy. Went on an open day to a course about Cyber Security and I was amazed.

### Now?
Now I know that the more I learn, the more I show, the more provide- **I worth more**. So I study until the little hours of the night, after everyone is sleeping, I'm trying the Python code one more time, running the pipeline again just to see if it's going to work without and bugs.

### Goals:
1. To be better. Everyday, Everytime.
2. Learn from everyone. In the bible there is a say that says "I learned from all my teachers, and from my students I learned even more".
3. Get that better role. Now I work as a System in mid level company. I was to get:
  - DevOps Engineer.
  - (Linux) System Administrator.

Be your best,
Moriel Mauni
