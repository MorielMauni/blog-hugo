So I took a long weekend with my family. We had huge fun.
We returned on Sunday and started to do some laundry because we don't have any cloths left.

Going to start back again on the DevOps Study app again, there is some big project at my job next week so maybe I will need to take some time off to chill before, I will update as I feel.

For now, just wanted to let you know we had a blast :-)
